Let him/her know that you are referring to what happened during the team \nmeeting a day before (not the pre sentation three weeks ago, for example).  \n\u2022 Behaviour  \n- Describe the behaviour. Make sure that you are being clear and objective. Focus on the actions   that your \ncolleague took, not his / her personality.  \n\u2022 Impact:  \nYou can make your feedback stronger by de scribing the impact of the - demonstrated behaviour. For instance, your \ncolleague\u2019s action - could impact one person, a few people or the whole group. Think of the big picture and choose \nthe impact that is most appropriate in each situation.  \n\u2022 The Next Step :  \nFinally, offer your colleague the next steps that he/she can take.

Be an active listener. Practice your effective listening skills. Encourage the person offering feedback to \ntalk. You will learn more about yourself, how others see you, and how others interpret your actions and \nbehaviors.   \n2. Be respectful. Be aware of your body language, facial expression, and tone. Maintain eye contact and be \ncareful not to get defensive (not even crossing your arms). If you disagree, are upset, or angry, give yourself \ntime to calm down before responding. And, when you do, carefully choose your words; they matter. Take it \nfor what it is; that is, feedback you can use to improve your performance. Think on how you can improve \nthe behavior, attitude, or situation. Learn from it.   \n3. Ask questions. Clarify doubts by asking questi ons. Be certain to ask questions that help you to \nunderstand the feedback. Ask for examples that support the feedback.   \n4. Show appreciation. Express your appreciation regardless of the type of feedback you receive. You can \nexpect that at several times duri ng employment, you will receive both positive and negative feedback. \nSaying thank you means that you acknowledge the effort that was taken to provide feedback.   \n5. Make a decision. Reflect on the feedback and decide your next steps, how are going to use the feedback \nto further your development. You don\u2019t always have to act on all the feedback that you receive. You build \nyour relationship with someone when they feel heard, which is ac hieved by you listening, without \njudgement. We would r ecommend, that you reinforce the value you place on their feedback by circling \nback around and letting them know what you ultimately did.

Hence there can be \na long time interval between the harassment and the actual complaint.   \nd) Handle complaints in a confidential manner and within the stipulated time period.   \ne) Submit annual report on sexual harassment cases, if any, and actions taken to address the same, \nto the CEO, Head of Human Resources and/ or designated authority.   \nf) Maintain all the data related to sexual harassment cases in the company. Document results of a ny \nsexual harassment complaint or investigation.

Hence there can be \na long time interval between the harassment and the actual complaint.  \nd) Handle compl aints in a confidential manner and within the stipulated time period.  \ne) Submit annual report on sexual harassment cases, if any, and actions taken to address the same, \nto the CEO, Head of Human Resources and/ or designated authority.  \nf) Maintain all the data related to sexual harassment cases in the company. Document results of any \nsexual harassment complaint or investigation. Not only the results, but also document any \ncorrective action that the Soliton or supervisor was asked to take.  \ng) Provide safety for the  complainant and his / her supporters, if such a need be felt and that the ICC \ncan recommend action against persons indulging in intimidation of the complainant or witness to a \ncomplaint.  \nh) Discard predetermined notions of how an accused should look or beha ve or dress. Be aware of \nstereotypes.
